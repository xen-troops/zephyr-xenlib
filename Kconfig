	  if you are running Zephyr as Dom0.

config XEN_LIBFDT
	bool "Enable libfdt support"
	help
	  Enable libfdt module. This module allows you to generate
	  Domain device tree based on the parameters set in the
	  Domain config. It provides complete toolset to work with
	  flattened device tree.

config PARTIAL_DEVICE_TREE_SIZE
	int "Domain device tree size"
	default 8192
	help
	  Maximum size of the domain device tree

config XEN_DOMAIN_MANAGEMENT
	bool "Enable Xen Domain Management"
	help
	  Enable domain management library. This library allows you
	  to create, destroy and manage xen domains.

config XEN_DOMCFG_SECTION
	bool "Enable Xen domain config section"
	default y
	depends on XEN_DOMAIN_MANAGEMENT
	help
	  Enable gathering domain configurations to a common section.
	  This allows you to declare multiple domain configs with
	  a DECL_CONFIG macro. Configs can be later accessed by
	  their name.

config XEN_DOMCFG_READ_PDT
	bool "Enable reading of domain partial device-tree (PDT) binary"
	default y
	depends on XEN_DOMAIN_MANAGEMENT
	help
	  Enables reading of domain partial device-tree (PDT) binary by using
	  callbacks in struct xen_domain_cfg.
	  It also enables this feature in "xu create" shell command which will
	  try to load PDT binary using struct xen_domain_cfg callbacks.

config XEN_CONSOLE_SRV
	bool "Enable Xen Console server"
	help
	  Enable xen console server. It should be included if you
	  are running Zephyr as Dom0, otherwise any DomU that uses
	  Xen para-virtual console (PVC) may lock up. On other hand,
	  this server can be omitted if you are certain that DomUs
	  will never touch PV console.

config XEN_SHELL
	bool "Enable Xen shell commands"
	select SHELL
	help
	  Enable set of Xen shell commands for domain management.

config XENSTORE_SHELL_READ_SIZE
	int "Size of xs read buffer"

	depends on XEN_SHELL
	help
	  Sets the maximum size that xs read cmd can handle

config XENSTORE_TREE_TRAVERSE_DEPTH
	int "Maximum xs traverse depth"
	default 8
	range 1 16
	help
	  Sets the maximum xs traverse depth to avoid stack overflow
	  in case of deeply nested XS trees.

config XRUN_SHELL_CMDS
	bool "Enable XRUN shell commands"
	help
	  Enable set of XRUN shell commands to manage xrun library calls.

config XEN_VCH
	bool "Enable Xen vchannels support"
	help

config PFN_CHUNK_SIZE
	int "Chunk size for memory mapping operations"
	default 128
	help
	  Chunk size for helper functions for mapping/unmapping
	  memory from guest domain to Dom0.

config DOM_MAX
	int "Maximum number of DomU"
	default 4
	range 1 32
	help
	  Maximum number of DomU that can be created and launched.

config XSTAT
	bool "Enable XSTAT support"
	help
	  Enable xstat support which allows statistic information about running domains

config XSTAT_SHELL_CMDS
	depends on XSTAT
	depends on SHELL
	bool "Enable XSTAT shell commands"
	help
